# An Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are your first foray into dealing with _collections_ of data. So far, you know how to store single values into variables, using `let` and `var`. But what if you wanted to store multiple data, without declaring `let` or `var for each one?

Arrays help you solve this problem, by providing you with an _ordered list_ of elements.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up your own arrays, and _iterate_ through each of the elements. Also in the process, you'll code a famous game called __Conway's Game of Life__!
